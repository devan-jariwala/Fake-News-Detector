Senator Claims New “National Weather Fee” Will Fund Anti-Hurricane Lasers

A controversial proposal circulating in Congress this week has stirred outrage after Senator Daniel Morcroft of Ohio announced a plan to implement a “National Weather Fee” on every American household. Morcroft claims the funding would support development of a classified government program designed to “disrupt hurricanes using high-frequency atmospheric lasers.”

According to internal memos obtained by the Capitol Daily Review, the proposed fee could reach up to $89 per month, depending on a household’s energy consumption. Morcroft argues that the technology could reduce natural disaster damage by “over 60%,” though no independent scientific organization has reviewed or confirmed these claims.

Critics point out that the senator has close financial ties to AeolusTech, a private contractor rumored to be developing weather-modification prototypes. Transparency groups are demanding the release of project documents that Morcroft’s office has refused to share, citing “national security limitations.”

Opponents in Congress called the proposal “a blatant misuse of federal funds,” with several lawmakers noting that similar atmospheric experiments were abandoned decades ago due to safety concerns. Despite this, Morcroft insists the new technology is “the future of climate resilience.”

Public reaction has been overwhelmingly negative, with many Americans accusing the senator of pushing a hidden corporate agenda under the guise of climate protection. No vote has been scheduled, and experts believe the proposal is unlikely to advance.
